# Code Of Joker on the Blockchain!!!!

Can you believe it? My most favorite game is now live on the blockchain.<br>
Play fee is just 0.505FLOW (0.005FLOW is used for network usage), and surprisingly if you won on the game, you can get 1.0FLOW!<br>
Wow, you can become literally a pro-gamer! You can live with just gaming everyday!<br>
The one game is about 5~6 minutes. So if you won the game continually an hour, you can get about 5FLOW! WoHoo!<br>
This is the homage to the SEGAâ€™s game, Code Of Joker which run 2013-7-11 - 2019-7-11.<br>
The game system is very similar to v1.0.0 of Code Of Joker. (But majority are not implemented, of course.)<br>
If you donâ€™t know COJ, please take a look at well-played gameâ€™s YouTube ðŸ‘‡<br>

# The game name is *CODE-Of-Flow*

This game is fully built on Flow Blockchain.

<br>This is the idea I planed to create for whole game APIs. But AWS's Lambda has the cron job function which is only available for one minite or longer.<br>
If I need 3 seconds each GraphQL subscription API, I have to set AWS's Step Function. But unfortunately this is created while the hackathon period, so I wanted the system more simple.<br>
This GraphQL api is only used for the notifications to notify game users the useful informations using Blockchain Events.

# Extending the ecosystem
I am planning to share the informations how I implemented the source code written in Smart Contract Language Cadence n Linkedin.<br>
This includes:<br><br>
*matchingStart* transaction: Matching function fully implemented on the Smart Contract, How to create Pseudorandom Number on the Smart Contract<br>
*get_current_status* script: This is the core script of this game, which returns the battle information if the game is started or returns the last matching timestamp if the game not started.<br>
*game_start* Transaction<br>
*turn_change* Transaction<br>
*put_card_on_the_field* Transaction<br>
*start_your_turn_and_draw_two_cards* Transaction<br>
*claimWin* Transaction<br>
*surrendar* Transaction<br><br>
