# Code Of Joker on the Blockchain!!!!

Can you believe it? My most favorite game is now live on the blockchain.<br>
Play fee is just 0.505FLOW (0.005FLOW is used for network usage), and surprisingly if you won on the game, you can get 1.0FLOW!<br>
Wow, you can become literally a pro-gamer! You can live with just gaming everyday!<br>
The one game is about 5~6 minutes. So if you won the game continually an hour, you can get about 5FLOW! WoHoo!<br>
This is the homage to the SEGAâ€™s game, Code Of Joker which run 2013-7-11 - 2019-7-11.<br>
The game system is very similar to v1.0.0 of Code Of Joker. (But majority are not implemented, of course.)<br>
If you donâ€™t know COJ, please take a look at well-played gameâ€™s YouTube ðŸ‘‡<br>
