  What does blockchain app development look like?
  
  Flow Blockchain has a wallet called Blocto, which makes it very easy to transfer Crypto Currency and create NFT wallets.

  The ease of transferring money and the instant creation of wallets means that money and goods can be exchanged with people all over the world in no time. When I published this book, I can easily say, "I want to pay you an honorarium, so give me your Blocto wallet address," and the transaction actually takes about 5 seconds and is completely stress-free.

  It's hard to find anything to stress about because Flow is an extremely secure, accident-free, and transparent blockchain.

  The Flow Blockchain website says it is developer friendly. This is true, and when you develop on Play Ground, you can share your source code with anyone, and if you share it on Flow's Discord, someone will respond to you right away. This is because Play Ground and the Flow Client Library (FCL) are developed with developers in mind, and this developer support system is one of Flow's strengths.

  Since it is the CTO of Dapper, the creator of Flow Blockchain, who submitted ERC721, Ethereum's NFT, the new features of the NFT will almost certainly become Flow's strength. NFT development using Flow Blockchain will likely accelerate in the future.

  However, building an NFT with Flow Blockchain is difficult for newcomers to understand how to implement, and the lack of books means that there is little information available for reference.

  In particular, after Stable Cadence was released in June 2022, contracts before and after the Breaking Change are mixed up, and information income for them is easy to understand for those who have already developed them, but for those who want to learn Cadence for the first time, the hurdle is quite high.

  This book describes how to write smart contracts using Cadence and the steps to actually release a game. Flow Blockchain around the game is a very attractive platform. The ability to exchange NFTs of any value with anyone in the world, or to pay in Crypto Currency, and the very high speed of the process itself, allows developers to build any Blockchain system they want on top of their own ideas. We will explain in an easy-to-understand manner where beginners are likely to get stuck, and we will work with you to get past the initial obstacle of creating an NFT, so we hope you will pick up this book, discover the joy of creating a blockchain application called Dapp, and build a new system in this world. I hope you will take this book and discover the joy of creating a blockchain app called Dapp and build a new system in this world.

  page1_5: `Getting Started with Cadence`,
  page2_1: '1 . 1 Getting Started with Cadence',
  page2_2: `Cadence is the smart contract language used in Flow Blockchain.
  Where to use the Cadence are as follows:

  * Smart Contract
  * Transaction
  * Script

  There are various blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon, but do you know how the smart contract language is used in these blockchains?

  (1) Smart contract itself inside the blockchain
  (2) Transaction part that makes changes to the smart contract
  (3) The part that obtains or changes  information inside the smart contract from a library in JavaScript

  Flow Blockchain uses Cadence as its smart contract language, while Ethereum and Polygon use Solidity. And this is where these smart contract languages work and how they work.`,
  page2_3: `In the case of Cadence, the Smart Contract Language of Flow, the library used in (3) is a JavaScript library called FCL (Flow Client Library).

  In the case of Solidity, the library used in (3) is a JavaScript library such as web3.js.
  
  Then, each of them passes a transaction to the blockchain, which writes the blockchain modification process. This process is the movement of (2).
  
  In the case of Cadence, the transaction calls the methods of the smart contract, and passes arguments to indicate how it should be changed. However, the calling process can be changed flexibly.
  
  In the case of Solidity, the transaction calls the methods of the smart contract, and passes arguments to indicate how it should be changed.
  
  In this way, you can see that Cadence and Solidity work in exactly the same way, just in different languages. However, Cadence is easier.
  
  In Cadence, the process (2) can be written later in Cadence, but in Solidity, the process (2) cannot be changed flexibly because it means only calling a method in a smart contract.
  
  Therefore, designing in the Solidity world takes time.
  
  In Solidity, all of (2) is built into the smart contract. Changes require deployment, which takes time and sometimes costs money.
  Cadence allows you to write code in Cadence to handle (2) inside the call, so you don't have to be nervous about creating a design that can handle the changes.
  
  That said, Cadence also does not reduce security, since a transaction cannot be executed without calling a smart contract method.  
  `,
  page2_4: ``,
  page2_5: ``,
  page3_1: `1 . 2 What is a blockchain, after all?

  A blockchain can store values in it. And smart contracts can determine its movement.
  Until smart contracts came along, it was not possible to program them to determine their movement.
  
  A smart contract is an arrangement that you make programmatically. This gives weight to the term decentralization. Because once the smart contract is placed on the blockchain (called "deploy"), there is no longer any way for the creator of that smart contract to go against its contents.`,
  page3_2: `1 . 3 What kind of programs can I program with smart contracts ?

  Anything is fine.
  
  Once a value is captured in the blockchain, it cannot be changed by others, so you can create a program that can easily make effective use of it.
  
  For example, you may want to develop software to properly track traceability, but write a smart contract on the blockchain to prevent the information from being tampered with.
  
  For example, to prevent global warming, you want to apply rules that cannot be changed by any national authority and are equal for everyone in the world as a smart contract, and impose fines on vehicular vessels that cannot be moved efficiently by ship or train.
  
  If I write it this way, you will understand that I can write anything.`,

  page4_1: `1 . 4 What industries are suited for businesses using Flow Blockchain ?

  This is my opinion, but I think the gaming industry is a good fit. As mentioned above, anything can be written in a smart contract, but Blockchain is a new technology and not everyone in the world knows how to use it.
  
  In contrast, games are enjoyed all over the world, and in the case of blockchain games, the value of the tokens used in the blockchain is universal, so revenue can be brought to a world-class revenue stream at once.
  
  Also, since blockchain games are basically possible as long as you have the Internet, as soon as the game is created, it can be released worldwide. Revenue also does not have to exclude people who do not have credit cards or other forms of payment.
  
  When you look at these features of blockchain games, do you notice something? Yes, it is easy to reach out to the world, even in countries where the business environment is less favorable.
  `,
  page4_2: ``,
  page4_3: ``,
  page4_4: ``,
  page4_5: ``,
  page5_1: `  The blockchain game is

  *No credit card companies are needed.
  *No banks needed.
  *No private network companies are needed as long as there is internet access. (This is on the condition that private information is not handled.)
  
    Yes, people all over the world can create games under equal conditions. Until now, it has been difficult to develop games for worldwide distribution in countries where these restrictions existed. (Although there are more restrictions now, such as anti-money laundering measures, etc.)
  
    Did you know that blockchain is attracting attention in Africa?
  Africa has the potential to get the most advanced technology in the world at once with blockchain technology. Not only South Africa, but also large countries near the equator such as Nigeria and Kenya have English as their official language, so it is easy to acquire information on cutting-edge technology, and blockchain has the potential to create the phenomenon of leapfrog, skipping the development stages along the way and catching up with the world's most advanced technology at once.
  
    Right now, this book is published as an e-book on Kindle, and if you could pay for it with crypto assets, you wouldn't even need a bank or credit card, it would be so convenient. 
  
    This is a long digression, but from the next page, I will start the technical explanation of the system development using Cadence.`,

  page6_1: `Features of Cadence - Smart Contract Language`,
  page6_2: `2 . 1 Features of Cadence smart contract language`,
  page6_3: `Cadence focuses on the shortcomings of Solidity, which make it easy for developers to commit fatal bugs, and focuses on creating a language from the developer's side.

  The following web page describes the five pillars of Cadence. Each of them is described there as follows
  
  https://developers.flow.com/cadence
  
  Safety and Securityâ€¦ This is the most important feature of Cadence and the most characteristic of Cadence. The language specification is so developer-oriented that it is difficult to create a vulnerable program. It is also meant to ensure security for the users who receive NFT assets.
  
  Clarityâ€¦ Readability of code, clarity of purpose, and lack of ambiguity in the source code. In particular, there is a language specification (resource oriented programming) that states that resources must always be moved somewhere, and has a strict specification that the program is not done until the resource is saved or destroyed.
  
  Approachabilityâ€¦ Provide approachability with the programming language for smart contract developers.
  
  Developer Experienceâ€¦ In addition to the above, the specification and tools provide a development support that does not undermine motivation during development.
  
  Intuiting Ownership with Resourcesâ€¦ Cadence is designed to retain the resources represented by the NFT and to make the best use of them.`,
  page6_4: ``,
  page6_5: ``,
  page7_1: `Differences between Solidity and Cadence`,
  page7_2: `The main difference is the wallet, which is the software used to store personal account information. The wallet must have a security feature to ensure that only the user can handle it. Solidity uses a metamask for the wallet, while Cadence does not.
  If an individual wants to manage his/her own security, he/she can use Blocto's Non Custodial wallet, for example.`,
  page7_3: ``,
  page7_4: `Why Flow Blockchain does not use metamasks`,
  page7_5: `  This is because, first of all, it is difficult for the general public to use the system. Some people may say that they need to manage their own wallet keys, but if that is the case, they will not play the game.
  The developers of Flow Blockchain were the developers of a game called Crypto Kitties, so they wanted to make a blockchain that was easy to use for the general public.

  The second reason is security. To make security strong, a metamask that is independent of any blockchain is not a good idea because Flow Blockchain users might lose their assets in a wallet.

  In order for the blockchain to be secure for users, the core development team of Flow chose not to use metamasks, and  also formulated a wallet with secure specifications.`,
  page8_1: `Wallet on the Flow blockchain`,
  page8_2: `  The de facto standard wallet for Flow Blockchain is Blocto. This wallet has the keys managed by the wallet company when the app is downloaded to Android or iOS. However, you can later change the key to manage it yourself.

  Blocto also allows you to create an account within a web browser without downloading the app. Therefore, to start the game, you only need a web browser. However, if you want to view NFTs or exchange crypto assets, it is much more convenient to download the app.`,
  page8_3: `Other differences`,
  page8_4: `  It is difficult to convey this without being misleading, but as I wrote in 1.1, they are basically the same.

    It is not the case that Flow Blockchain is so focused on security that it is getting in the way of the decentralized nature of the blockchain itself. On the contrary, Flow's core development team has always had a development roadmap that puts the decentralized nature of the blockchain first, and has been implemented and announced accordingly.
  
    The exact same thing is true for retrieving blockchain information through JavaScript libraries and changing values held within smart contracts.
  
    Flow Blockchain's Cadence came out much later than Solidity, so it has the distinction of having its shortcomings addressed.
  
    Solidity is well-known and many blockchains use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) which handles Solidity, but there are security concerns.
    Perhaps because Solidity was not suitable for implementing the secure transfer of NFT assets, and perhaps because it was the CTO of Flow Blockchaion who proposed NFT, Flow Blockchain has developed an original smart contract language, the Cadence.`,
